<H3>Example session</H3>
<P>
The first screen of the QuBE program just asks for a DICOM file to load:<br/>
<img src="images/screen1.png"/>
<p>
After loading the file, the first frame of the angiography run is shown:<br/>
(For demonstration purposes, a very poor blush sequence has been used).

The run can be played, or paused and any frame can be selected by dragging the slider at the bottom.
By clicking in the image, the polygon where blush is expected can be constructed.

After a satisfying polygon is drawn, the "Recalculate" button will start the QuBE calculation process. This may take a while, depending on the computer hardware the program is run on.
In this case, a very poor QuBE value is obtained, as hardly any darkening of the area of interest occurred.
